## Screenshots


The start image screen. 

Originally, I thought of doing a 3x3 grid but decided to make it simple for now.

When a User click the Spin button, the reel images changes randomly. 

In the beginning, I only have a three-of-a-kind payout, but winning something became difficult. 

So, I added a two-of-a-kind payout to make it fun.

## Getting Started

[Slot Machine Game](https://brownbugz.github.io/slotmachine/)

* 50 credits appear on the credit box to start playing. 
* Click the blinking spin button to start the game.
* Be sure to have your sound on (if it is okay with your surroundings).
* Your starting credits will be deducted by 5 every time you click the spin button.
* Randomly, the images will change every time you click the spin button.
* Payouts are given to two-of-a-kind and three-of-a-kind. 
* If you have ended up with zero credits, the game will reset.

> **DISCLAIMER: I didn't put a dollar sign on the credits and winnings to remind you that this is just a school project.
I won't be owing anyone money. HaHa!**

## Next Steps
