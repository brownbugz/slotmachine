Originally, I thought of doing a 3x3 grid but decided to make it simple for now.

When a User click the Spin button, the reel images changes randomly. 

In the beginning, I only have a triple-image payout, but winning something became difficult. 

So, I added a double-image payout to make it fun.

[Slot Machine Game](https://brownbugz.github.io/slotmachine/)

1. 50 credits appear on the credit box to start playing. 
2. Click the blinking spin button to start the game.
3. Be sure to have your sound on (if it is okay with your surroundings).
4. Your starting credits will be deducted by 5 every time you click the spin button.
5. Randomly, the images will change and it will either give a payout or nothing.
6. If you get a double-image results on the reel, you'll gain credits depending on the image. 
7. If you have ended up with zero credits, the game will reset.

**DISCLAIMER: I didn't put a dollar sign on the credits and winnings to remind you that this is just a school project.
\I won't be owing anyone money. HaHa!**

## Next Steps

Planned future enhancements:

* I plan to add more grids
* Add spin effect on the image reels
* Improve the look to resemble an actual casino slot machine
* Create a pull down lever instead of a spin button
