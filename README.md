## Screenshots

This is the start image screen. Originally, thought of doing a 3x3 grid, but I decided to make it simple for now.

When a User click the Spin button, the reel images changes randomly. In the beginning, I only have a triple-image payout, 
\but winning something became difficult. So, I added a double-image payout to make it fun.
